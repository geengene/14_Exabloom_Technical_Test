# Setup instructions

## How the application works

## Assumptions

1. assuming for if/else node, if creates a branch with existing "children" nodes(existing nodes below the if/else node), and else will create a new branch/path with the else node + end node.

## Challenges

1. setting up custom add edge button's logic
2. making node positions dynamic so that nodes/edges don't overlap each other esp for if-else node
3. passing data to Form

## How I resolved challenges
